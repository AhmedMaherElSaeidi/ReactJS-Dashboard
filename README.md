# React Dashboard Project

This React project demonstrates a dashboard containing various data visualizations and features to manage and explore data efficiently. The dashboard includes the following components:

## Charts
1. **Pie Chart**: Represents data in a circular statistical graphic divided into slices to illustrate numerical proportions.
2. **Bar Chart**: Displays data using rectangular bars with lengths proportional to the values they represent.
3. **Card Chart**: Presents summarized data in a compact and visually appealing format.
4. **Donut Chart**: Similar to a pie chart but with a blank center, allowing for additional information or data to be displayed.

## Data Table with Pagination
A table is implemented to display data in a tabular format. The table utilizes pagination functionality, enabling users to navigate through large datasets.

## Data Details
When a record is selected in the data table, specific details regarding that data entry are displayed, providing users with in-depth information about the selected record.

## Deployment
